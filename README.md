## Hello, you.

If I had to pick a theme for this page, it would be *practical solutions over elegence*.  I certainly appreciate elegence, but I find myself attracted to messy problems in spaces where users are already entrenched.

In the past I've worked on **password managers** and **fighting ebook DRM** with small open source tools.  Lately, I'm focused on learning to write simpler code with strict typing and conventional style.

My dream is to ~~delete code~~ every day.
