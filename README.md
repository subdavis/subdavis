## Hello, you.

If I had to pick a theme for this page, it would be *practical tools over elegence*.  I certainly appreciate elegence, but I find myself attracted to messy problems in spaces where users are already entrenched.

In the past I've worked on small open source tools for **managing passwords** and **fighting ebook DRM** that filled a void in their respective communities.  Lately, I'm focused on learning to write simpler code with strict typing and conventional style.   I'm also interested in how larger codebases are managed and organized over time.

My dream is to ~~delete code~~ every day.
