Dear reader,

If I had to pick a theme for these projects, it would be *practical tools over elegance*.  I certainly appreciate elegance, but I find myself attracted to messy problems in spaces where users are already entrenched.

In the past I've worked on small open source tools for **managing passwords** and **fighting DRM** that filled a void in their respective communities.  Lately, I'm focused on learning to write simpler code with strict typing and conventional style.   I'm also trying to learn how larger projects are managed and organized over time.

I wish I could ~~delete code~~ every day.
